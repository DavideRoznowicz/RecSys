RecSys for Information Retrieval


* in [data](/data) we can find the dataset we used (raw) and a [readme.txt](/data/readme.txt) detailing the structure of the dataset.

* In [main.ipynb](/main.ipynb) we can find the notebook going step by step through the project details.

* In [model_trained](/model_trained) we can find the instance of a trained model (30 iterations); the parameters for this saved model are the same ones that we can see in the jupyter notebook.
